## How we built it
We built the application in two parts and then merged them into one. We started by using AWS Amplify as our backend to hold developer information and open-source information. Additionally, we decided to use React.js for our frontend/UI using MUI which allows us to write code without needing separate CSS files.

## Challenges we ran into
+

Some challenge that we had run into was figuring out styling in react using MUI as it was our first time using this in a project. Setting up the backend took quite a while due to the difficulty of using AWS with so little experience with it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of what we have implemented in the time frame with the lack of knowledge and experience we had when walking into this dubhack. We took nothing and made it into something and were able to create a working project with a front and back end that was able to communicate with each other.

## What we learned
What we have learned is how to use react to develop a front end and use AWS more effectively than before to set up our back end. We learned how to manage time better under stressful deadlines and came out with a working project. A nuanced understanding of time management and how to work effectively in a team.

## What's next for Matchbox
Next comes scaling our application to add more variety and adding features to improve the user experience for our developers.
